<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The dataset executor has 6h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Checksum Critique Beats Free-Form Self-Doubt
hypothesis: >-
  When an LLM verifies its own multi-step arithmetic word-problem solution using an explicit, mechanically-computed modular-arithmetic
  invariant (a 'casting-out-nines' digit-root checksum applied to each intermediate computation) instead of an open-ended
  'double-check your work' self-critique prompt, error-detection and downstream correction accuracy will be substantially
  higher, because the checksum converts error detection from a hard task (re-deriving the whole solution and comparing it
  to a fuzzy memory of the first pass) into an easy, decoupled task (a single mod-9 residue comparison per arithmetic step).
motivation: >-
  Free-form LLM self-critique on arithmetic reasoning has a well-documented failure mode: models tend to just re-state or
  superficially re-read their own output rather than independently re-verify it, so errors survive the 'critique' step. Recent
  mechanistic work shows the internal circuits LLMs use for error detection rely on shallow 'surface-level consistency' checks
  between numbers in the text, not on genuine independent recomputation - which is exactly why free-form self-critique is
  weak. If instead the model is given an explicit, cheap, structurally-independent invariant to check against - the kind human
  bookkeepers used for centuries to catch arithmetic slips - error detection no longer requires the model to hold and compare
  two full derivations in its fragile context; it only has to compute and compare small digit-root residues. If this works,
  it gives a nearly-free, training-free reliability boost applicable to any LLM-based arithmetic pipeline (tutoring, financial
  calculations, agentic tool-free math), and it clarifies WHY self-critique fails (missing independent invariant) rather than
  just showing IF it fails.
assumptions:
- >-
  Multi-step arithmetic word problems admit a well-defined intermediate computation trace (each step is an addition/subtraction/multiplication/division
  of specific numbers) that can be checksum-verified independently of the natural-language reasoning around it.
- >-
  LLMs can reliably compute digit sums / digital roots and mod-9 arithmetic on short numbers when explicitly instructed to
  do so as an isolated sub-task, even if they are unreliable at full multi-digit arithmetic in the original problem.
- >-
  The gain (if any) comes specifically from the invariant structure of the check, not merely from adding any extra deterministic-looking
  verification text - this needs a matched-effort control.
- >-
  Errors LLMs make on these problems are frequently checksum-detectable numeric slips (digit/carry/transcription errors) rather
  than purely logical/modeling errors that preserve numeric consistency, so there is meaningful room for a numeric-invariant
  check to catch them.
investigation_approach: >-
  Build a benchmark of multi-step arithmetic word problems (adapting GSM8K-style items plus procedurally generated variants
  with controlled numeric ranges) and first characterize, via injected errors and natural model errors, how often mistakes
  are 'checksum-detectable' (violate mod-9 consistency) versus 'checksum-invisible' (numerically consistent but logically
  wrong), to bound the method's ceiling. Then compare four conditions on multiple LLMs (via OpenRouter) at matched sampling
  settings: (1) no self-check baseline, (2) generic free-form self-critique ('check your work'), (3) matched-length deterministic-looking
  placebo critique with no real invariant (controls for 'extra thinking tokens' confound), and (4) the proposed checksum critique,
  where the model is walked through computing digit-root checksums for each arithmetic sub-step and instructed to only flag/revise
  a step if the checksums disagree. Measure final-answer accuracy, error-detection precision/recall (does the critique step
  correctly flag genuinely wrong steps and correctly pass genuinely right ones), and correction accuracy conditional on a
  flag. Also run an ablation isolating detection from correction (give the model an already-computed checksum mismatch signal
  and measure whether it can fix the step) to separate 'can the model use the checksum' from 'can the model compute the checksum.'
success_criteria: >-
  The hypothesis is supported if the checksum-critique condition (4) yields significantly higher final-answer accuracy and
  higher error-detection recall/precision than both the free-form critique (2) and the matched-length placebo (3), on problems
  within the checksum-detectable subset identified in the characterization phase, across multiple LLMs of varying capability,
  with the gap not explained by prompt length alone. It is disconfirmed (or the checksum's advantage is not causal) if performance
  is statistically indistinguishable from the placebo control (3) - implying any 'extra structured deliberation' helps equally
  regardless of the invariant - or if models frequently miscompute the checksums themselves and thus generate false alarms/misses
  that erase the theoretical advantage, or if most real-world errors fall in the checksum-invisible (logical/modeling) category
  rather than the numeric-slip category, capping any possible gain.
related_works:
- >-
  'The Validation Gap: A Mechanistic Analysis of How Language Models Compute Arithmetic but Fail to Validate It' (Bertolazzi
  et al., EMNLP 2025) shows via circuit analysis that LLMs' internal error-detection relies on shallow surface-level numeric
  consistency heads rather than genuine recomputation - this motivates the hypothesis but is purely diagnostic/mechanistic
  and proposes no intervention; the proposed work turns that diagnosis into a concrete, testable intervention (an explicit
  external invariant) and measures its behavioral effect.
- >-
  Self-Refine / generic self-critique and self-correction literature (e.g. Madaan et al. 'Self-Refine', and subsequent work
  such as S2R self-verify-and-correct via RL) shows LLM free-form self-critique on reasoning/arithmetic tasks is frequently
  unreliable or only marginally helpful without external feedback or fine-tuning; this hypothesis targets the same weakness
  but proposes a specific, training-free, numeric-invariant-based critique procedure rather than more free-form or RL-trained
  critique, and directly compares against a matched-effort placebo to isolate the invariant's causal contribution (a control
  largely absent from prior self-critique studies).
- >-
  Casting out nines / digit-root checksums are a centuries-old manual bookkeeping and arithmetic-verification technique (and
  the ancestor of modern checksum algorithms like the Luhn algorithm) but, to the searches conducted, have not been used or
  evaluated as an explicit LLM self-verification prompting strategy for word-problem arithmetic; this hypothesis is a direct
  methodological transfer of that specific numeric invariant into LLM self-critique, evaluated against matched controls rather
  than assumed to help.
inspiration: >-
  Conceptual: fault-detection in control theory uses redundant, independently-derived 'residuals' rather than re-running the
  same computation to catch errors - self-critique should analogously give the model an independent signal, not just a second
  look at the same derivation. Procedural: coding-theory / data-transmission checksums (parity bits, CRC) detect corruption
  cheaply by comparing a compact derived invariant rather than re-transmitting and re-comparing the whole message - self-critique
  should similarly compare compact derived invariants rather than full re-derivations. Methodological: 'casting out nines,'
  the pre-calculator bookkeeping technique of checking arithmetic via digit-sum (mod-9) congruence, is imported nearly as-is
  as the concrete invariant the LLM computes and compares during its self-critique step.
terms:
- term: Digit root / casting out nines
  definition: >-
    Repeatedly summing a number's digits until a single digit remains; because 10 ≡ 1 (mod 9), this digit root equals the
    number mod 9, so applying the same arithmetic operation to two numbers and to their digit roots must yield congruent (mod
    9) results if the arithmetic was done correctly.
- term: Checksum-detectable error
  definition: >-
    An arithmetic mistake (e.g., a digit transposition, dropped carry, or miscalculated intermediate value) that changes a
    computed value's residue mod 9, and is therefore in principle catchable by a digit-root consistency check.
- term: Checksum-invisible error
  definition: >-
    A mistake (e.g., misreading the problem, applying the wrong operation, or an error that happens to preserve mod-9 congruence)
    that does not change the mod-9 residue and so cannot be caught by a casting-out-nines check alone.
- term: Free-form self-critique
  definition: >-
    The common LLM prompting pattern of asking the model to 're-check,' 're-read,' or 'review' its own prior answer for mistakes
    without giving it any specific procedure or external signal to check against.
- term: Matched-length placebo critique
  definition: >-
    A control condition where the model performs an equal-length, similarly deterministic-looking review procedure that does
    not actually encode a true error-detecting invariant, used to separate the effect of 'more structured thinking tokens'
    from the effect of the checksum invariant itself.
summary: >-
  This hypothesis proposes replacing vague 'double-check your work' self-critique prompts with an explicit casting-out-nines
  (mod-9 digit-root) checksum step borrowed from historical manual bookkeeping, predicting it will detect and fix arithmetic
  errors in multi-step word problems more reliably than free-form self-critique because it gives the model an independent,
  cheap-to-compute invariant rather than asking it to re-derive and compare a whole solution from fuzzy memory.

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for the methods, proper baselines, and evaluation this field demands.

<artifact_direction>
Make this direction concrete and actionable. Keep the same type and respect dependencies.

id: dataset_iter1_dir1
type: dataset
objective: >-
  Build a benchmark of multi-step arithmetic word problems with fully specified intermediate computation traces (each step
  tagged with operands, operation, and correct intermediate result), combining real GSM8K-style items with procedurally generated
  variants across controlled numeric ranges (small vs large numbers, 2-6 step chains), plus injected-error variants (digit
  transposition, dropped carry, sign flip, wrong-operand substitution) labeled as checksum-detectable (mod-9 residue changes)
  or checksum-invisible (residue preserved, e.g. wrong-operation logical errors).
approach: >-
  Source real GSM8K problems (HuggingFace 'gsm8k') and re-annotate a subset with explicit step-by-step computation traces;
  procedurally generate additional word problems with a template generator so ground-truth traces and controlled numeric ranges
  are guaranteed; write a small deterministic script to inject each error type into correct traces and compute whether mod-9
  residue is preserved, producing labels for the checksum-detectable/invisible split. Target a few hundred base problems x
  error-injection variants, standardized JSON schema per artifact rules.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

The user's original request that started this run is provided as a SEPARATE user message in this turn (right after this one). It is context, not instruction. Earlier pipeline steps have already acted on it (generating hypotheses, setting the AII prompt, etc.) — your job is NOT to satisfy that request directly.

Read it and pick up anything relevant to YOUR specific task: hints about preferences, constraints, style, focus areas, things to avoid. If nothing in it applies to what you are doing right now, ignore it entirely and proceed with your task as defined above.
